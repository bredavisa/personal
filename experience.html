        <h1>My experience in education</h1>
        <p> I first started getting awards in 3rd grade.I got awards for citizenship. 
        In 5th grade,I joined the Pom-Pom team. I got rewards and certificates. I did this 
        throughout 6th grade, but I decided to swtich to cheer. I then did cheerleading 
        from 7th grade to 10th grade. In 10 grade, i did Upward Bound at the Gary Comer Youth Center.
        Now this summer, I took a break from cheer camp 
        and tried out coder space. </p>
